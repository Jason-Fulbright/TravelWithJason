								<p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this article are the electronic banking systems that accept players from the United States that wish to play in online casinos.</p>

									<h5>My trip details</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Duration: 90 days </li>
										<li>Time Frame: Mid-Aug to Late-Nov </li>



									</ul>
									<p></p>
								</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">

									<h5>Weather</h5>
						<p>I was in the Galapagos from Mid-August to Late-November which is their dry season. However, in the Galapagos there is a daily mist that engulfs the islands in a dense cool fog called 'Gar√∫a'. This is due to the tempature differnce between the lava rock islands and the cold Pacific ocean. If you are visiting this time of year I suggest a medium to light rain jacket to cover you during these times.	</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
									<h5>Food</h5>
						<p>There was a variety of cuisines to choose from on the islands. Isabela host over twenty delicious resturants including multiple pizza joints, a sushi bar, amazing steak houses, and many authentic South American digs. My favorite resturants were... Shawarma with its amazing shawarma wraps, huge burgers, and to die for shakes. Maestro De Casa and their huge fish and chips platter or the mixed ceviche. For great pizza Endemic Turtle is the spot. El Faro offered good food and drinks with an amazing area full of games for the whole family. Isabela Grill is a tasty steak house with all kinds of interesting sauces and twist on South American grilling. And last but not least Oasis was an amazing traditional Ecuadorian resturant and while its off the beaten path it definitely worth the walk.
					</p>	</div>
						<div class="col-lg-12">
										<h5>The Locals</h5>
							<p>The islanders of the Galapagos are some of the friendliest people you can meet, and how could they not be they live on one of the most beautiful and unique islands in the world. Everyone greets you walking down the streets, people are helpful as well as thankful, no one is in a rush to get anywhere, and overall there is a great island vibe surrounding the town.</p>
							</div>

	<div class="container border-top-generic">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-12">
										<h5>Driving Conditions</h5>
							<p>It is very unlikely that you will be driving anywhere in the Galapagos since cars are so valuable and there aren't many of them. But don't worry, most things are walking distance and if not there are plenty of taxi trucks/buses to go around.</p>
						</div>


						<div class="col-lg-12">
										<h5>Safeness</h5>
							<p>Even though the Galapagos were orginally set up as a prison collony, that stigma is long gone. This was one of the safest places I have ever been to, I dare say safer than most cities here in the States. This is because your on an island with essecially no where to run so if someone robs you or assults you they WILL be found. This is made odvious when you walk around town and see that people will leave their empty cars running, with no worry of it being stolen, while visiting friends or getting groceries. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Priceyness</h5>
									<p>Many things (manufactured goods mainly) are expensive on the islands due to the fact it has to be shipped from the mainland so be sure to pack your electroncis, shoes, and bathroom necessities. However, resturants, bakeries, and other foods were priced similar to here in the States, if not cheaper. The cost for things like dive trips was higher than you would find in the U.S. (around $150USD per 2 tank dive but its worth every penny). </p>

								<div class="container border-top-generic">
												<div class="row">
								<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Touristyness</h5>
									<p>How touristy it felt depended mostly on the island. I found Santa Cruz to be the most touristy but also offered the most to do, Isabela second, and Floreana last with almost no signs of tourism at all. And I did not get a chance to visit San Cristobal.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Nightlife</h5>
									<p>There are bars around the islands which offer moderatly priced drinks and inexpensive shots. My favorites on Isabela were Boobie Bar for a sunset cocktail and Bar De Beto for late night dancing. I promise you'll enjoy!</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Essencial stops</h5>
												<p>If you get the chance visit Floreana! The town is very small and humble but the snorkeling at Devil's Crown and Champion were the best in my life hands down, no questions asked, you have to do it. If you can't make it to Floreana there are amazing dive/snorkel sites on all of the other islands that you must try. All of the islands are surrounded by nutrient rich waters that host thousands of beautiful fish, rays, and crustations. On land you have to hike up Siera Negra Volcano(Isabela) or around the sink holes of Santa Cruz. Also check out the tortoise rearing centers to see the Giant Galapagos Tortoises before they get huge and to learn about their amazing history!  </p>
