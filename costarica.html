									<h5>My trip details</h5>

										<li>Duration: 7 days </li>
										<li>Time Frame: Early July </li>
											<li>Locations: San Jose/Puerto Viejo/Cahuita </li>

												<h5>Summary</h5>
									<p>Costa Rica will always be one of my go-to vacation spots. It is a country surrounded by beautiful water, covered in exotic plants and animals, and filled with some of the kindest and most environmentally-friendly people I've ever meet, and for those reasons not only will I visit Costa Rica again, I may move there.   </p>
							</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">

									<h5>Weather</h5>

					<p>My trip to Costa Rica was at the beginning of July and lasted for seven days. This was during the rainy season but the rain didn't bother us much; however, if a few rainy days on your vacation isn't what you want to deal with and you have the option, go later in the year (Oct-Sept). Either way the weather will be fairly warm and I suggest shorts, t-shirt, and a light rain jacket for the occasional shower.  </p>
				</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
									<h5>Food</h5>
						<p> There was always good food around in Costa Rica. The traditional Costa Rican meal consisted of a grilled meat or fish, rice, beans, and plantains, very filling and quite delicious. If that isn't what you are looking for there are a variety of foreign restaurants to choose from. Some of the best restaurants in Costa Rica were Asian Latin-American fusions.
					</p>	</div>
						<div class="col-lg-12">
										<h5>The Locals</h5>
							<p>Costa Ricans are some of my favorite people in the world. They are extremely helpful, easy to get along with, and almost everyone is environmentally conscious, my kinda people! </p>
							</div>

						<div class="col-lg-12">
										<h5>Driving Conditions</h5>
							<p>The driving conditions in Costa Rica are a bit hairy. The big cities, like any city, is congested and people are rushing to get around. Outside of the cities the roads wind through jungle filled mountains down to farmland and small towns. These roads are quick but not always reliable as there are frequent mud slides that can take roads out of commission for days to weeks. </p>
						</div>


						<div class="col-lg-12">
										<h5>Safeness</h5>
							<p>I never felt any uneasiness during my entire stay in Costa Rica. . </p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Priceyness</h5>
									<p>Costa Rican stores and restaurants were on average more expensive when buying Western products but relatively cheap when buying local products. It is important to note that some places here do not accept credit cards so bring plenty of cash, and you will of course need to get your money exchanged.   </p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-12">
													<h5>Transportation</h5>
										<p>We booked all of our transportation online before arriving in Costa Rica and had zero problems with getting around once we were there despite hearing many rumors that it was better to book your transportation in person. </p>
									</div>

												<div class="row">
								<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Touristyness</h5>
									<p>Costa Rica was not touristy in the slightest. Never was I offered a "deal on a ziplining adventure.." or hassled to by things by anyone on the street. This can be contributed to the fact that I stayed in very small towns outside of the day trip to the capital, San Jose.  </p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Nightlife</h5>
									<p>The nightlife of Puerto Viejo and Cahuita was very slow. Considering this was the low season, I could imagine Puerto Viejo having an extremely fun night scene during the high season or surf tournaments, but I would not recommend Cahuita if you are looking for exciting nights out on your vacation.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Essential stops</h5>
												<p> You must visit the Cahuita National Park or the Gandoca Manzanillo National Wildlife Refuge while you are in this area. These are huge parks created along the Costa Rican Caribbean Coast that host a variety of tropical wildlife and plants. In only a few hours of walking I stumbled across so  many monkeys, a few snakes, sleeping sloths, and uncountable tropical flowers. And if you want to see more, there are guides available at the park entrance. </p>
