									<h5>My trip details</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Duration: 7 days </li>
										<li>Time Frame: Early July </li>
											<li>Locations: Isla Colon/Bastimentos </li>


									</ul>

												<h5>Summary</h5>
									<p>I loved visiting these remote yet busy little islands for their delicious food and exciting nightlife but its the breathtaking nature that will get me back there again.   </p>
							</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">

									<h5>Weather</h5>
						<p>My trip to Panama was at the beginning of July and lasted for seven days. This was my first excursion to Panama and will forever be one of my favorite family trips. We meet the most amazing people, stayed in some of the coolest houses, and adventured through the wildest jungle. We were there during their wet season which honestly didn't bother us very much but it rained a small amount at least every other day. If you don't want to deal with the rain and have the option go later in the year (Oct-Sept). As for clothing I suggest as light as possible since it can be quite humid. I only wore shorts and t-shirts while there. </p>
				</div>	<div class="col-lg-12">
									<h5>Food</h5>
						<p>The main island of Bocas Del Toro had quite a few options for restaurants and all of them that I tried were delicious. Upon arrival to the island we ate at a waterfront bar, grill, and surf shop called La Buga where I had one of the best tuna sandwiches of my life (pictured below). My second favorite restaurant and by far my favorite bar on the island is Skully's. Located outside of town this hostel, bar, and restaurant combo is a must try. During the day you can find skilled surfers shredding the dangerous coral reef break off of the white sand beach which happens to be Skully's front door. Right off of the sand you find the pool, free entry after the purchase of a drink, and the beautiful open air bar surrounded by a variety of outdoor seating like the ocean front hanging day bed. On top off all this, there is a delicious pizza restaurant directly across the street owned by an extremely friendly Italian.
					</p>	</div>
						<div class="col-lg-12">
										<h5>The Locals</h5>
							<p>The islanders of Bocas were very friendly and welcoming. Many people down there are Ex-Pats (Former Americans) like the owner of Skully's and those who aren't typically know English.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

						<div class="col-lg-12">
										<h5>Driving Conditions</h5>
							<p>It is very unlikely that you will be driving anywhere in Bocas since it is such a small island and I'm not sure there is even a car rental agency. But don't worry, everything in town is walking distance and if you want to leave town there are plenty of taxi trucks to go around.</p>
						</div>


						<div class="col-lg-12">
										<h5>Safeness</h5>
							<p>I never felt unsafe in Bocas but I'll admit my brother and I felt a little uneasy when hiking to town on Bastimentos, a small island to the East of the main island. We had taken a rough path from our Airbnb into town and as we got into town the path opened up into the poorer neighborhood and we were eyed down by a group of guys but we continued to walk into town with out any problems. I never had any other problems with how safe I felt while on the trip and this occurrence was nothing worse than what happens when you walk through a bad neighborhood in the U.S. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Priceyness</h5>
									<p>Many things (manufactured goods mainly) are expensive on the islands due to the fact it has to be shipped from the mainland. There wasn't much outside of a few grocery stores so be sure to pack your electronics, shoes, and bathroom necessities as they may be hard to find on the island. Restaurants, bakeries, and other foods were priced slightly higher than here in the States. It is important to note that many places here don't accept credit cards so bring plenty of cash, USD is the currency here. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-12">
													<h5>Transportation</h5>
										<p>Getting around these islands was very fun. One of the main methods of transportation is water taxi which I LOVE! Other than that you'll find inexpensive taxi trucks that can take you to the grocery store, restaurants, ect..  </p>

								<div class="container border-top-generic">
												<div class="row">
								<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Touristyness</h5>
									<p>The town of Bocas was not over touristy. There were of course a few people trying to sell you snorkeling trips and four-wheeler rentals but they were few and far between. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Nightlife</h5>
									<p>The nightlife of these islands was very lively with a weekly bar crawl that hit many of the water front bars and Skully's had a crowd every night. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-12">
												<h5>Essencial stops</h5>
												<p> You must do the Flying Pirates four-wheeler rental and do the jungle path. It is miles of untouched jungle and beach front that is like nothing you have ever seen before. It feels as if you are on an adventure thousands of miles from town once you enter the park. We loved it sooo much we did it two days in a row and I'll be out there again when I go back.   </p>
